// GetClosestRegion tries to find the region(s) that are closest to the origin region.
// First, the SortByProximity function is used to generate multiple lists of generic regions, ordered by their 'distance' to the origin region.
// Then, for each of these lists, all of its entries are mapped using the specified mapper and extended with the specified pre- and suffix.
// For each string generated this way, the list of available regions is filtered for entries that match the resulting regular expression.
// If any matches are found, the function is aborted and returns only the matches found for the current list.
// If no match is found for any list, nil is returned.
// An error is only returned if the generated regular expression is invalid.
//
// The idea is, that all returned specific regions are considered to have the same minimal distance to the specified origin.
//
// The preferSameRegion field controls whether other directions within the same region should be prioritized over neighboring directions of neighboring regions.
// For example: GCP currently only has regions in the south(east) of Australia, so there is no exact match for the generic region specification (AUSTRALIA, NORTH).
// With preferSameRegion set to false, the function returns GCPs asia-south* regions because Asia's south is considered only one step away from Australia's north, opposed to Australia's south, which is considered to be two steps away.
// With preferSameRegion set to true, the function returns GCPs australia-south* regions because even though it is the opposite direction, they still share the same region and are therefore preferred.
// If GCP had zones in central, east, or west of Australia, all of these would be considered one step away from (AUSTRALIA, NORTH). In this case, with preferSameRegion set to true, only these regions would be returned,
// neither asia-south*, nor australia-south*. With preferSameRegion set to false, the returned selection would contain australia-central*, -east*, and -west*, as well as asia-south*, because all of them are considered the same distance away from (AUSTRALIA, NORTH).
